Welcome to MEANING

Author: Jason Qin

Purpose: MEANING is a piece of interactive fiction and command line story that requires user input. Based on the input, the program will take different paths and open various files in the directory, which will perform various tasks. Every line in the story is based on a color and has differing endings based on the paths you choose. The colors incorporated also match the hall colors for the 2023 IMSA Clash of the Halls!

Instructions to run:

Install the followig programs with "sudo apt-get install
lolcat
toilet
cowsay
sl
libaa-bin
figlet
imagemagick"

To start the program, make sure you are in the 'UNIX_BASH_GAME' directory and type 'bash START.sh' in the terminal.

This interactive piece will require user input, which is indicated whenever the > symbol is presented.

When prompted, please keep phrases simple and in lowercase. The game can be completed with solely one word commands / verbs. The piece is interactive, but has limited vocabulary and will only accept certain commands to progress. Examples include: talk, north, south, east, west, hug, walk...

Whenever there is a line of dialogue that is not a prompt, press enter to continue.

Whenever a pop-up window/tab is opened from the program, feel free to interact with the tab and then close the tab (and press enter) to continue with the program.
